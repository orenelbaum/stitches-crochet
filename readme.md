# Development is on hold until Modulz figure out if they want to continue maintaining Stitches. If they do they might already have their own static extraction solution, so this library might not be necessary. Either way if they continue maintaining Stiches I will consider working on this project again.

# stitches-crochet

Stitches Crochet is a set of general utilities for [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) (not to be confused with [Stitches utils](https://stitches.dev/docs/utils)).

Stitches Crochet is currently React only. A SolidJS version is coming soon.

Currently Stitches Crochet has 2 utilities:

- **Styleable Components**

  Stitches Crochet provides a function that creates styleable components.
  Styleable components are similar to styled components, however their API is a little bit different.

  Like styled components, styleable components can have base styles. However, the way you customize a styled comoponent is by choosing variants (defined in the base styles) and adding more styles through the `CSS` prop.

  The way you customize a styleable component is by adding the style rules directly as props to the component, and with the `boolVariants` prop which conditionally applies sets of styles.

	Example:

  ```tsx
	const StyleableComp = createStyleableComponent(Comp, { color: "Blue" })

	<StyleableComp
		props={{ text: "Wrapped React component" }}
		background="Red"
		margin="20px"
		boolVariants={[
			[someBool, css({ padding: "10px" }), styled("a", { fontWeight: "bold" }) ],
			[!someBool, { background: "Yellow" }]
		]}
	/>
  ```

- **Styled Primitives**

  `StyledPrimitives` is a proxy that lets you access automatically created styleable component wrappers for HTML elements.

	Example (using `C` as alias to `StyledPrimitives`):

	```tsx
	<C.div color="YellowGreen">
		Styleable primitive
	</C.div>
	```

[See usage example](https://github.com/orenelbaum/stitches-crochet-example)

This project is in early development. Don't use it in production.

## Installation and getting started

Install stitches Crochet with

```bash
npm i stitches-crochet
```

Replace `createStitches` with `configureCrochet`. It takes the same argument - a Stitches config, and returns the same object with two added properties: `createStyleableComponent` and `StyleablePrimitives`.

- Use `createStyleableComponent` to create custom styleable components.
- Use `StyleablePrimitives` for quick access to styleable HTML elements with no base styles.

It's recommended to alias `StyleablePrimitives` with a one letter name. You can use `C` for crochet (note that it needs to be a capital letter so you can use it inside a JSX tag, for example `<C.div>`).

## API

### `configureCrochet`

```js
const { createStyleableComponent, StyleablePrimitives, ...stitches } = configureCrochet(stitchesConfig)
```

This function is the same as createStitches, except the returned object also has `createStyleableComponent` and `StyleablePrimitives`.

### `createStyleableComponent`

```js
const styleableComponent = createStyleableComponent(componentOrElement, ...baseStyles)
```

Creates a new styleable component.

Arguments:

- `componentOrElement` - An HTML element or a React component to be wrapped with a styleable component.

- `baseStyles` (optional) - A collection of style objects, styled components, CSS components, functions returned from CSS components, and class names.

Returns: a styleable component

### Styleable components

```tsx
<MyStyleableComponent
	props={underlyingComponentProps}
	{...styleRules}
	boolVariants={arrayOfBoolVariants}
>
	{ someChildren }
</MyStyleableComponent>
```

A wrapper around an HTML element or a React component, similar to styled components except the API is a bit different. Styleable components give you a more concise way to add one off customizations.

Props:

- `props`: Props to be passed to the underlying component. This field is optional if the underlying component doesn't have any required props.

- `boolVariants` (optional): An array of boolean variants (a little bit different than normal Stitches boolean variants). Each boolean variants is itself an array in which the first value is a boolean expression (which is the condition for the variant to be applied) followed by a collection of style objects, other styleable components, styled components, CSS components, functions returned from CSS components, and class names.

  An example of a boolean variant:

  ``` js
  [someCondition, { color: "blue" }, css({ background: "green" })]
  ```

  In this example if `someCondition` is true, `color: Blue` and `background: Green` will be applied to the component.

  An example of `boolVariants` prop:

  ``` js
  [[someCondition, { color: "blue" }, css({ background: "green" })]]
  ```

  This is the same as the boolean variant example, except it's wrapped in an array.

- Any CSS property or util defined in your Stitches config is a valid prop.
  
  For example:

  ```jsx
  <MyStyleableComponent
	  color="Black"
	  p="3px"
  >
	  { someChildren }
  </MyStyleableComponent>
  ```

  The `p` prop represents a util in this example.


### `StyledPrimitives`

  A proxy that lets you access automatically created styleable component wrappers for HTML elements with no base styles.
  It's recommended to alias `StyledPrimitives` as one letter, in this example I'm going to use the alias `C` which stands for crochet.

  An example:

  ```tsx
	<C.div color="YellowGreen">
		Styleable primitive
	</C.div>
  ```
	
  You can access any HTML element this way.

## Roadmap:

- Better types
- A SolidJS version
- Add some missing features to styleable components
- More utility functions
